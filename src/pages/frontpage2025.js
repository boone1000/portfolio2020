                    <h1>Ashley Boone</h1>
                    <p className='main'>Hello! I am a PhD candidate in <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/phd-human-centered-computing">Human Centered Computing</a> at Georgia Tech advised by <a href="https://ledantec.net/">Dr. Christopher A. Le Dantec</a> and <a href="https://www.carldisalvo.com/">Dr. Carl DiSalvo</a>. My research is funded by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. </p>   
                    <p className='main'>My research examines data production in community-based organizations as an emerging form of digital activism. Taking a critical perspective on data, I explore the work of producing and using data to achieve social change at the local level. Data serves as an entry point to explore the social practices and technologies employed by community-based organizations as they work to understand and take action around contested aspects of city life, including immigration, conservation, and climate. My goal is to understand how data does or does not contribute to social or political change at the city level and to build digital tools that directly benefit my community partners' efforts to pursue action goals through data. </p>
                    <p className='main'>Before starting my PhD, I attended the University of Washington and graduated with a B.S. in <a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/">Human Centered Design and Engineering</a> and worked for a brief period as a UX/UI designer. I anticipate graduating in Spring 2026 and am looking for a tenure-track faculty position or postdoc role starting in Fall 2026. </p>
